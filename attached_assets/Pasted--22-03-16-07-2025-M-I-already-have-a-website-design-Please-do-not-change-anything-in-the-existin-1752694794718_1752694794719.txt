I need you to do the following:
	1.	Add a new “Projects” page. Make sure the design matches the current site style (layout, fonts, colors). No need to add real content, just create the design/structure.

	•	If I add new content later, the structure should allow that content to follow the selected language automatically.

🔒 Important Notes:
	•	Do not alter the design, structure, or behavior of the current website.
	•	The switch must be smooth and instant, without needing a page reload.
	•	Use best practices for multilingual websites (e.g., lang attributes, dir="rtl" when Arabic is active).
	•	All text should be professionally translated to native-level Arabic
